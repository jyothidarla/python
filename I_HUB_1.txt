How to create and save a python file:
=====================================
We can create and save a python file with .py extension with any_name.

Ex:
===
index1.py
demo1.py
test1.py

In_valid file name:
===================
12346.py
test 1.py


->print()
->id()
->type()


->print():
==========
It is a predefine function in python.The main objective of print() function
is to display the content on the console or application console with '' or
"" or '''''' or """""" or variable(An identifier).


Ex1:
===
print('Core Python session is going on at IHUB')
print("Core Python session is going on at IHUB")
print('''Core Python session is going on at IHUB''')
print("""Core Python session is going on at IHUB""")
Eid=1001
print(Eid)


Ex2:
===
print('Core Python session is going on at IHUB')
print()
print("Core Python session is going on at IHUB")
print()
print('''Core Python session is going on at IHUB''')
print()
print("""Core Python session is going on at IHUB""")
Eid=1001
print()
print(Eid)
print()
print("End of an application")


OUTPUT:
======
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
Core Python session is going on at IHUB
1001

C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Python_24_Batch>python index1.py
Core Python session is going on at IHUB

Core Python session is going on at IHUB

Core Python session is going on at IHUB

Core Python session is going on at IHUB

1001

End of an application

C:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Python_24_Batch>py index1.py

Python as Program:
================
If python developers are writing the business logic without using predefie
module then it  is said to be Python act as program


Python as Program:
=================
print('Core Python session is going on at IHUB')
print()
print("Core Python session is going on at IHUB")
print()
print('''Core Python session is going on at IHUB''')
print()
print("""Core Python session is going on at IHUB""")
Eid=1001
print()
print(Eid)
print()
print("End of an application")

Python as Script:
=================
If python developers are writing the business logic with using predefie
module then it  is said to be Python act as script


Ex1:
===

import time
print('Core Python session is going on at IHUB')
print()
print("Core Python session is going on at IHUB")
print()
print('''Core Python session is going on at IHUB''')
print()
print("""Core Python session is going on at IHUB""")
Eid=1001
print()
print(Eid)
print()
time.sleep(3)
print("End of an application")
